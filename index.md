My name is Arthur Thuy and I am a PhD researcher at the [Data Analytics cluster](https://www.ugent.be/eb/mio/en/research/dataanalytics) of the Faculty of Economics at Ghent University. My PhD focuses on uncertainty estimation in neural networks, communicating when a model's output should (not) be trusted for decision-making.
