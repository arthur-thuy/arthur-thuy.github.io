My name is Arthur Thuy and I am a PhD researcher at the [Data Analytics cluster](https://www.ugent.be/eb/mio/en/research/dataanalytics) of the Faculty of Economics at Ghent University. I am also a PhD fellow at the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO).

My research focuses on supporting business decision-making with uncertainty estimation in neural networks. As such, uncertainty communicates when a model's output should (not) be trusted for decision-making. I am interested on applications in operations research such as manufacturing and educational data mining. I work on:
- **Classification with rejection**: reject predictions when the model is uncertain.
- **Active learning**: query the most uncertain instances for labeling.
